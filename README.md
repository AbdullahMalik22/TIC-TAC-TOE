# TIC-TAC-TOE
A C++ Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players compete on a 3x3 grid, aiming to align three marks in a row. With input validation and a user-friendly interface, the game updates after each move and announces a winner or tie. A great showcase of core programming concepts like arrays, functions, loops, and conditionals.
